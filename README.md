# Childhood Asthma Rates in Allegheny County

This project aims to analyze two datasets to identify strategies for improving asthma outcomes and reducing healthcare costs in Allegheny County. The project focuses on reducing emergency department visits for children with asthma, with a specific focus on those who receive Medicaid-funded services.
The findings of this project have the potential to improve the lives of children with asthma in Allegheny County and beyond. The project has the potential to inform policy decisions aimed at reducing healthcare disparities and enhancing access to healthcare services for children with asthma. Sharing best practices and lessons learned can influence programs and policy choices that aim to decrease healthcare disparities and improve asthma outcomes.


## Data Sources (in data folder)
Childhood Asthma Healthcare Utilization dataset from data.gov

American Community Survey dataset for demographic information

Map structures

## Methods
1. Reviewed raw data files of both datasets to identify potential ways to combine the files and gain a general understanding of the information contained within them.

2. Utilized Colab to analyze and clean the data, ultimately merging the two files into a single dataset.

3. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the merged dataset to gain insights into the data's characteristics and relationships between variables.

4. Utilized mapping structures for Allegheny County to enhance analysis.

5. Evaluated the resulting output dataset to answer key questions.

## Key Findings
1. Asthma controller events are not equally distributed across the county.

2. Median income and asthma events have a negative relationship (until a certain income).

3. Asthma controller events are positively correlated with asthma-related emergency room visits.

4. Cluster-based strategy highlights outliers.
